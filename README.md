## Hi there! My name is John Gerega
Welcome to my GitHub, take some time to see what I'm up to!

## About me
- ‚úè Senior at Pennsylvania Western University's California branch with a current GPA of 3.94. (Expected Graduation: May 2026)

## Skills and Past Courses
- Programming languages: Java, JavaScript, COBOL, Assembly Language, C, C++, C#, Python, HTML
- Git/GitHub
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Algorithm Analysis
- Programming Concepts
- Operating Systems
- Structures of Programming Languages

## Current Projects
- Fun Fact: I am an avid runner üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, which is what inspired me to start my current project
- I am working on a running tracker. I use an app currently synced with my watch, but there is a paywall that I simply refuse to pay
- Since my watch has the data, I want to create a program that emulates my current app
- I would like to create a database for this app, something that I do not yet have the tools to do, but am looking for more information every day on how to do so
- Ideally, the app will display a total mileage, total activity count, and giving the user ability to view an individual activity. Individual activites will have mileage, pace, heart rate zone, calories burned, elevation gained, and a name.

## Current Courses
- Senior Project I
- Theory of Languages
- Data and Network Communication
- General Education Credits
